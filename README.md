## Topic: Laravel Routing (Web & API)

Today I practiced Laravel Routing, including web routes and API routes. This helped me understand how to handle different kinds of HTTP requests and organize route files.

## Tasks Completed:

- Created basic web routes in `routes/web.php`
- Used route parameters and named routes
- Created a web route that returns a view
- Grouped routes with `prefix()`
- Added sample API routes in `routes/api.php`
- Grouped API routes for versioning or admin prefixes
